BrowserQuest
============

BrowserQuest is a HTML5/JavaScript multiplayer game experiment created by [Mozilla](http://github.com/mozilla/BrowserQuest). The basic version of it can be accessed through Mozilla's servers here: http://browserquest.mozilla.org/. 

This fork intends to build on the basic MMORPG capabilities that were included in the original BrowserQuest and add more elements of an MMORPG such as:
* Inventories.
* Player vs. Player.
* Experience points and levels.
* Spells and a skill bar.
* Party and Guild system.
* Area/party/guild/private chat.
* ... and more!

I'm currently in the process of re-writing the client side from JavaScript to [Google Dart](http://www.dartlang.org) as it was hard to reason about the original JavaScript code in a growing project. Future plans include optimizing the client side and re-writing the server side in Dart for maximum code reusability and type safety.

Interested in being a contributor? Are you an awesome 8-bit artist and willing to make items/maps/monsters/spell effects? Are you an MMORPG enthusiast and know a lot about game designing? Are you a great Dart/JavaScript/web developer, willing to solve some really cool problems efficiently, while playing games 100% of the time? Can you create medieval-themed RPG music and sound effects?
Contact me ([dvirazulay](http://github.com/dvirazulay)) and let's talk about games development in the HTML5/WebSockets/canvas/WebGL era.
